        <p> My name is Michael Belmear and this is my first web page. I am a Finance and 
            Computer Science student here at MSU and I would like to go into front-end web development. 
            I am most excited for this class this semester because HTML is easy to learn and makes me feel smart. 
            This is going to be a great semester of learning for me and I think it will be fun! My personal favorite 
            IDE for Computer Science is VS Code which is what I will be using for the remainder of the semester.
